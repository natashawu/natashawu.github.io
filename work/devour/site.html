  <h2>:DEVOUR</h2>

  <p>I've always believed that eating was an emotional thing. You ask someone, "What do you feel like eating?", "What are you in the mood for?" Yet, most apps ask us to make this decision based on things like ingredients, price, or proximity. And while those things are important to making your final decision, I believe that the true reason for your indecision is that you're feeling a variety of different, and sometimes seemingly conflicting, emotions. When you have a meal that really satisfies you, you're not checking off items on a checklist -- you're eating something that you were completely in the mood for. And if that's the case, then why not just pick what you want to eat based on your mood?</p>

  <p>:Devour is a site of curated recipes where you can literally eat your feelings. Developed and hand-illustrated by yours truly. For the full experience, please check out the live site <a href="devourgoodfood.com">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Bon app√©tit.</p>
