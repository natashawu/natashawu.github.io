<!-- ![Hey! That's me](/images/me.jpg){: .about-image } -->

Hey there! My name's Natasha. I'm a [designer](http://be.net/nwu), a [maker](http://instagram.com/natashaswu) and a [baker](http://instagram.com/ganashbakes). Here you'll find some of the work I've done and thoughts on my adventures in ~~programming, design and occasionally other only slightly related topics~~ life.

When I'm not sitting in front of a computer, you'll find me by the nearest oven, baking anything from cookies to casserole. Or outside in the fog, attempting to master the hills of San Francisco.

If you want to:  
a.) work together  
b.) go hunting for new bakeries  
c.) be friends  
d.) all of the above
