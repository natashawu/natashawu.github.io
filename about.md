![Hey! That's me](/images/me.jpg){: .about-image }

Hey there! My name's Natasha. This is where I write down my thoughts on things related to my adventures in ~~programming, design and occasionally other only slightly related topics~~ life.

When I'm not sitting in front of a computer, you'll find me by the nearest oven, baking anything from cookies to casserole.

Currently, I'm exploring the foggy city of San Francisco.
