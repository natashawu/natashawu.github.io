Hello! Welcome to my Plog. This is where I write down my thoughts on things related to my adventures in programming (and occasionally other only slightly related topics).

Born and raised in California, I decided I needed a change of pace. In the spring of 2015, I packed up a couple suitcases and moved to a city I'd never been to before -- Chicago! There, I attended a coding boot camp that focused on: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript and Angular. Currently, I'm back in California, experiencing life in the foggy city of San Francisco. 

When I'm not sitting in front of a computer, you'll find me by the nearest oven, baking anything from cookies to casserole.
