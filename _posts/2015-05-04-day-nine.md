My friends and family are honestly the best. Without them as a support system, I definitely would not have been able to do what I’m setting off to do. California, you’ve been so good to me. Thank you. 

First day in Chicago has already been quite the adventure!

* In an attempt to avoid the ridiculously long taxi line, I opted to take the train into The Loop. After wrestling with the ticket machine, I finally got it to take my money and purchased my ticket for the orange line.

* Instead of transferring to the red line, I decided to just call an Uber to take me the rest of the way. Upon exiting the train, my luggage and I got stuck in the revolving gate at Randolph / Wabash. Determined not to make the headlines of the local news (“California Girl Gets Stuck Exiting the El”), I doggedly inched my way out of the gate. 

* Without enough strength or balance to carry all my luggage down a flight of rickety wooden stairs in one go, I proceeded to carry my suitcase (48 lbs.) and duffle bag (24 lbs.) down half a flight at a time until I reached street level. 

* As I approached my Uber, the driver popped open the trunk and waited for me to load my luggage into the car. After finally settling in to the front seat, he jokingly asked “Did a little too much shopping, huh?” I proceeded to restrain myself from punching him in the face. 

* As I stood outside the building of my temporary home, with my duffle bag hanging around my neck like a chunky statement necklace (as the shoulder strap had broken as I exited the train), my AirBnB host and I texted back and forth trying to figure out the entrance code to his apartment building. 080 -- never would have guessed that. 

* Luckily, at the end of the night, I was able to catch up with two familiar faces :)

It wasn’t easy, but I made it. And I’m not planning on stopping any time soon.
