title:  "Day #23 - Revisiting Ruby & Learning Shortcuts"
---
Today, we reviewed what we’d learned in our class prework about Ruby. So far, it’s been great! I’m finding Ruby very intuitive in terms of syntax, which definitely makes it a lot easier to pick up. Historically: 

* Ruby was invented around 1995 by a Japanese software programmer named, Yukihiro Matsumoto
* It was developed as a language that would be closest to the human language and thus, help programmers focus on coding itself rather than being distracted by remembering complicated syntax. 

We also learned a lot about our text editor of choice: Sublime Text. Shortcuts that have made my life much easier: 

* Comment out a line: CMD + /
* Going to the front or end of a line: CMD + left/right arrows
* Insert line before: CMD + SHIFT + enter
* Move a line or section: CTRL + CMD + up/down arrows
* Delete entire line: CMD + delete
* Indenting: CMD + ]
* Unindenting: CMD + [
* Show/hide sidebar: CMD + k + b
* Selecting multiple lines: CMD + click
* Selecting multiples of the same word (after word is already highlighted): CMD + d

There are WAY more helpful shortcuts in Sublime than the ones I've listed above, but I'm still in the process of remembering all of them. In the meantime, here are some helpful resources I found:
