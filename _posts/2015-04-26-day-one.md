title:  "Day #1 - Out of the Loop"
---

I recently quit my job as a graphic designer at an entertainment ad agency in Los Angeles to move over 2,000 miles away to a city I’ve never been to before, to pursue a career path that I have no background in. Why? Because the best cure for complacency is change. 

I’ve wanted to learn how to code for a while now as I’ve always thought it to be an integral part of being a strong designer in our digitally-focused world. I kept telling myself I would just learn on my own. With all the online programs and tutorials out there, how hard could it be? “Now that I’m out of school, I’ll have so much more free time to accomplish my life goals!” I thought. Little did I know that on the days when I actually got out of work at a decent hour, all I wanted to do after battling traffic to get home (yes, sometimes there’s still traffic in L.A. at 8PM) was get a couple extra hours of sleep or me-time. 

I loved the people that I worked with, but the repetitiveness of what I was doing at work was leeching away all the creativity out of a job that’s meant to be creative. And it wasn’t just the work I was tired of, it was me. I was tired of being consistently decent. I was tired of being content with the status quo. I was tired of who I had become. 

Wake up, work, sleep. Wake up, work, sleep. Go out on Saturday. Recover on Sunday. Repeat. 

One day, I called my mom in a panic and told her that I felt like I was treadmill that had no stop button. I was letting external factors control what I really wanted to do and my soul was suffering from it. I was stuck in an infinite loop and I couldn’t find ctrl + c. In that moment, I realized that the only way to get off that treadmill, was to jump. So I did, and never I looped back (heh heh. Clearly it’s just me laughing...).

Now, here I am, enrolled in code school and phenomenally excited to start learning something new. 

Today marks the first day of my journey to becoming a programmer. From installing Rails to learning about conditionals, most of the day was spent doing this:

Funny enough, we also learned about loops today!

Slowly, but surely, I can feel myself dipping my pinky toe into the giant ocean that is programming. I know it’s only going to get harder from here, but I also know that I’m ready for the challenge.
