title:  "Day #30 - What's in a Web Request?"
---
You go to the address bar in the browser, type in “facebook.com” and viola!, you see the familiar blue and white website frequented by millennials (ok, it’s really cross-generational now -- my two-year-old cousin and my seventy-eight-year-old grandma both have a Facebook) around the world. 

But what really happens when you type in that web address?

Think back, to the days of typing “http://” as a prefix. Yeah, I know, it’s been a while. But that is the beginning of a web request, or an HTTP request. HTTP is the simple protocol (kind of like a language) that browsers and servers use to communicate with each other. Basically, when you type in that address, your computer sends a web request to get something (a file, an image, etc.) from a server. The server then passes its response to the browser where you (hopefully) see what you’re looking for. 

To the best of my current knowledge, web request always contains an HTTP verb and a URL. An HTTP verb defines the action to be taken on the URL and the URL tells the server where to look for the appropriate information that it will eventually send back to the browser. 

And that, my friends, is what I learned about web requests today in a nutshell.
