title:  "Day #22 - The In-Person Beginning"
---
It was a drizzly Sunday morning. The day we had all been waiting for finally arrived -- the first day of school! 

After a tour around the amazing 1871 coworking space, we began an overview of key lessons we would consistently be reminded of throughout the class. A few that stuck:

* Every piece of tech has its pros and cons -- we were reminded that there is a time and place for everything. There are rarely hard, fast rules about what language/software/etc. works best 100% of the time (even if many developers think there are). 
* Tinker! -- we were told that programming is about testing many possible solutions. If you’re not sure which way to go, just try something out and see what happens. 
* Always be learning -- wonderfully simplistic and completely self-explanatory.

Our first lecture made me feel like a true hacker. Wait...I can do all these things from the Terminal?! From ```cd-ing``` into new directories (basically going from one folder to another WITHOUT using Finder!) to learning the dangers of ```rm -rf``` (this gives us the power to delete ANY file on our computers...permanently), at this point, we felt pretty much like computer whizzes. 

Then, we learned about this confusing thing called Git and this popular site that uses it called GitHub. All in all, it’s a site where you can push your code into the cloud so that if (**when** -- as our instructor always says) your computer crashes, you still have a backup copy of it. It’s also commonly used as a way for programmers to collaborate on projects together. 

The most important four lines of code that I learned today: 

```
git init
# This line tells git to initiate tracking changes of the folder you’re currently navigated in

git add --all
# This line prepares to add all the files to a git repository

git commit -m ‘initial commit’
# This line commits any changes made and allows you to put in your own commit message between the apostrophes

git push origin master
# This line pushes all the files up to GitHub in a new repository that you create
```
