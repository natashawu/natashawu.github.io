Day after day of this adventure here in Chicago, I am reminded of how I wouldnâ€™t be here without the support of my friends and family. Thank you to everyone who believed in me :)

I can't thank you enough for your patience, time and kindness. If there were a "Best Personal TA" award, you'd get it for sure.
