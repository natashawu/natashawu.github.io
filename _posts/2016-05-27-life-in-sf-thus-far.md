I wish I had written more blog posts between this last one this next one. It's been a little over a year and a month since I started this blog and here's what I've been up to:

**Late-September, 2015 - Moving back to California**

When I first made the decision to move back home, it felt like I was admitting defeat. While I had received multiple job offers from companies in Chicago, I didn't feel like any of them were the right opportunity for me. I felt like I was so close to "making it" in a new city. I had a new set of skills under my belt, I had a whole new network of friends, but I just couldn't seem to find that perfect job offer. Unfortunately, I was slowly, but surely draining my bank account. So I spent my birthday weekend in Chicago, said goodbye to friends, new and old, and reluctantly flew home.

**November, 2015 - What I learned from TAing**

A couple months later, still without a full-time job, I accepted a teaching assistant position from the coding boot camp that I'd graduated from -- they were opening up a branch in San Francisco. I remember wishing that I could have been one of those role model TAs, working at a fancy new job post-graduation. I wanted to be able to tell people that I'd done it, I'd become a software engineer, not a teaching assistant. But I accepted the position regardless because I needed the work experience, and the money.

Class started and something horrible happened -- when asked to explain something, I realized how unfamiliar I was with some of the topics I had just learned six months ago. The first couple days I experienced major impostor syndrome. It was like walking on stage to perform a something you'd practiced for months only to realize you'd forgotten most of a piece. It sucked. (I can't believe I'm publicly admitting this but...) There were times when I purposely avoided eye contact with students because I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to answer their questions. I felt so pressured to know everything about programming. But I didn't know everything, in fact it was quite the opposite. I knew VERY little about programming and to this day, I still feel that I have so much to learn. I think that's what they don't tell you after these coding bootcamps. They don't tell you that what you've learned is a very basic foundation for something much bigger, something that never ends. Programming is a field designed for people who truly never want to stop learning. And that's something that makes the field so wonderful, yet so daunting at the same time. If you love to solve problems, you will never get bored. But you will also never know everything -- you will never know all the languages, all the rules, or all the gotchas. Hopefully, what you will learn is how to problem solve like an engineer.

The three most important things I learned from TAing (aside from just relearning things that I had forgotten):


1.  How to debug the weirdest problems
2.  How to explain complicated concepts using everyday English
3.  How to be okay with not having all the answers

I didn't know it then, but this position would turn out to be crucial to me getting my next job.

**February, 2016 - Why did you do it, Nick Fuelling?**

Nick Fuelling lived in a room in Noe Valley. He showed me the room I would be renting from him and it was perfect. We met up a few days later at a 24-hour donut shop up the street to sign the lease. The week I'd be moving in, I found out that Nick Fuelling scammed me and 30 other people out of our deposit money. He walked away with 70 grand in cash. I lost some of my faith in humanity that day, but I like to think that I also grew a lot from that experience. And maybe next time, my skepticism will kick in sooner rather than later.
