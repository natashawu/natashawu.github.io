I wish I had written more blog posts between this last one this next one. It's been a little over a year and a month since I started this blog and here's what I've been up to: 

**Late-September, 2015 - Moving back to California**

When I first made the decision to move back home, it felt like I was admitting defeat. While I had received multiple job offers from companies in Chicago, I didn't feel like any of them were the right opportunity for me. I felt like I was so close to "making it" in a new city. I had a new set of skills under my belt, I had a whole new network of friends, but I just couldn't seem to find that perfect job offer. Unfortunately, I was slowly, but surely draining my bank account. So I spent my birthday weekend in Chicago, said goodbye to friends, new and old, and reluctantly flew home. 

**November, 2015 - What I learned from TAing**

A couple months later, still without a full-time job, I accepted a teaching assistant position from the coding boot camp that I'd graduated from -- they were opening up a branch in San Francisco. I remember wishing that I could have been one of those role model TAs, working at a fancy new job post-graduation. I wanted to be able to tell people that I'd done it, I'd become a software engineer, not a teaching assistant. But I accepted the position regardless because I needed the work experience, and the money.

Class started and something horrible happened -- I realized how unfamiliar I was with some of the topics I had just learned six months ago. The first couple days  

I didn't know it then, but this decision would turn out to be crucial to me getting my next job.
