Dear Future Natasha,  
These are some of your current thoughts at 25 (in no particular order).

*  Take a second to chill every now and again (You have way too much white hair for a 25-year-old. Just sayin').
*  Be present. You never know when the best moment of your life is going to end. Don't take it for granted.
*  Believe in yourself, or else no one else will.
*  You are braver than you think. Remember to have confidence in yourself and your abilities. They will surprise you!

Also, remember that these are things you love in life:  

*  Your family & your friends
*  Baking
*  Being creative - whether it's through design, development, painting, writing, etc.
*  Awesome food
*  Dancing & being healthy

At the time of this letter, you were having trouble with figuring out what you wanted to do with your life. Typical quarter-life crisis stuff. As of now, here's your list of completely "blue sky" dreams (aka dreams without a filter of reality placed over them):

1.  Run my own design studio
2.  Work at a famous bakery
3.  Own a bakery
4.  Become an awesome designer with coding skills to match
5.  Work abroad while traveling
6.  Dance in a dance company
7.  Make money doing what I love / love my job
8.  Make & save enough money that I can take care of myself and my parents without having to worry about unforeseen events
9.  Be one of those people who can sketch cool things on busses / trains
10.  Start an organization that teaches life skills to high-school students
11.  Save a life
12.  Learn how to really sew and make something I can wear
13.  Start a vegetable garden
14.  Become an expert at something
15.  Perform on stage with someone famous and/or be interviewed by someone famous
16.  Participate in a competitive cooking show

I hope that by the time you read this again, you'll have accomplished some or maybe even all of these dreams in some way, shape, or form. You deserve the best. And if you aren't getting it now, you should change that.

With love,  
Past Natasha
