        </h2>

        <p>We’ve been working on our capstones for a good couple weeks now and it’s been a lot of hard work, but pretty rewarding as well. For me, one of the most frustrating parts about creating my Rails app has been debugging. Throughout the course, we’ve learned how to use IRB and Rails console as tools for debugging. But to be honest, Rails console still freaks me out -- the syntax is really difficult for me to remember and one misplaced curly brace immediately returns a whole slew of error messages. User friendliness rating on a scale of 1 to 10: -3</p>

        <p>Prior to this course, I was telling anyone who asked that I would be learning Ruby on Rails, not knowing at all what Ruby or Rails really was. A typical conversation went like this: </p>

        <p>Today, we reviewed what we’d learned in our class prework about Ruby. So far, it’s been great! I’m finding Ruby very intuitive in terms of syntax, which definitely makes it a lot easier to pick up. Historically: </p>
